# HashMap

Hashmap.py contains a class for a Hashmap with amortized constant time look-ups. This Hashmap has the following methods: insert(x), remove(x), contains(x), and clear(). Although linear or quadratic probing is a more efficient way to resolve collisions, I decided to implement a Hashmap with separate chaining due to time restrictions. The only requirement that you need to have installed is Pythonâ€™s math library.
